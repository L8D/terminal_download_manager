terminal_download_manager
=========================

Download manager using terminal/cmd. Not for GUI lovers :P 


manual:

			1-Command 1: single
			#Wait until asked for input
			#input format: url filename
			#example:  http://www.whatever.com/whatever.txt something.txt
			# Leaving filename empty will result in it being named according to original filename
			#example: http://www.whatever.com/whatever.txt 
			# ^ This would name the file something.txt
			#Warning: Do not use spaces in urls
			#Warning: Use www. or some other thing in urls. Don't put something like:
			# shit.com and put instead www.shit.com
			# And make sure to not forget the .com or .gov or whatever the hell you're using :P
			#After that input the location when asked for it

			2-Command 2:batch
			#Wait until asked for input
			#Enter download location
			#from now on on every line 
			#you use the same input format as that of single downloading
			#and you put 'done' without the quotes when you're done with adding downloads
			#example:
			www.shit.com/shit1.txt filename.shit
			www.shit.com/shit2.txt filename2.shit
			done
